# Quantum-code

This is a repository dedicated to uploading quantum programming code using PennyLane. aimed at starting your journey into the quantum world!


## Installation

- As a first step, you need to have Python 3 installed in its latest version. You can download Python from its official website: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- As a second step, you need to install the PennyLane library. To install this library, run the following command:

```bash
  pip install pennylane
```
- As a third step, we will install Jupyter Notebook as an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for running our code. It is widely used for executing quantum programming simulations, and in this case, for working with PennyLane.
```bash
  pip install jupyter
```
- When cloning the repository like that:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Kycoon04/quantum-code.git
```
- Navigate to the "jupyter" folder, open your computer's terminal, and run:
```bash
  python -m notebook
```
- And the IDE will automatically open in your web browser. If it doesn't open, it will be available at:
```bash
  localhost:8888/tree
```
